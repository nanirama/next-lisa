          contains additional legal terms, including provisions that limit our
          liability to you and require individual arbitration for any potential
          legal dispute. To use the Services, you must accept all of the terms

          any time by posting the amended Terms on Company&rsquo;s website(s)
          and mobile application (collectively, the &ldquo;Platform&rdquo;). Any
          use of the Services after our publication of any such changes shall
          constitute your acceptance of the Terms as modified. However, any
          dispute that arose before the modification shall be governed by the
          Terms (including the binding individual arbitration clause) that were
          published and in place at the time when the dispute arose.

          remedies for copyright holders who believe in good faith that material
          appearing on the Internet infringes their rights under copyright law.
          If you believe in good faith that content or material on this Platform
          infringes a valid copyright owned by you, you (or your agent) may send
          Company a notice requesting that the material be removed, or access to
          it blocked. This request should be sent support@hellolina.com.
        </p>
        <p>
          The notice must include the following information: (a) a physical or
          electronic signature of a person authorized to act on behalf of the
          owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed; (b)
          identification of the copyrighted work claimed to have been infringed;
          (c) identification of the material that is claimed to be infringing or
          the subject of infringing activity; (d) the name, address, telephone
          number, and email address of the complaining party; (e) a statement
          that the complaining party has a good faith belief that use of the

          perjury, that the complaining party is authorized to act on behalf of

          wrongly filed against you, the DMCA permits you to send us a
          counter-notice. Notices and counter-notices must meet the then-current
          statutory requirements imposed by the DMCA. Notices and

        <h2 className="text-xl mt-4 mb-2">Disputes</h2>
        <p>
          If a dispute of any kind arises, we want to understand and address
          your concerns quickly and to your satisfaction. Please contact us at
          support@hellolina.com with any dispute. If we cannot resolve your
          concerns, we agree to an informal and inexpensive dispute resolution
          process requiring individual arbitration. &ldquo;Disputes&rdquo;
          between you and Company, including Company Parties, are defined for
          the purposes of these Terms to include any claim, controversy, or
          dispute (whether involving contract, tort, equitable, statutory, or
          any other legal theory) between you and Company including, but not
          limited to, any claims relating in any way to these Terms (including
          its breach, termination, or interpretation), any other aspect of our
          relationship, Company advertising, and any use of Company
          services.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <h2 className="text-xl mt-4 mb-2">Binding Individual Arbitration</h2>
        <p>
          You and Company agree to arbitrate all Disputes. Arbitration is more
          informal than a lawsuit in court and seeks to resolve disputes more
          quickly. Instead of a judge or a jury, the case will be decided by a
          neutral arbitrator who has the power to award the same damages and
          relief that a court can. ANY ARBITRATION UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL BE
          ONLY BE ON A INDIVIDUAL BASIS; CLASS ARBITRATIONS, CLASS ACTIONS,
          PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL ACTIONS, AND CONSOLIDATION WITH OTHER
          ARBITRATIONS ARE NOT PERMITTED, AND YOU ARE WAIVING YOUR RIGHTS TO
          HAVE YOUR CASE DECIDED BY A JURY AND TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION
          AGAINST COMPANY. If any provision of this arbitration agreement is
          found unenforceable, the unenforceable provision shall be severed, and
          the remaining arbitration terms shall be enforced (but in no case
          shall there be a class arbitration). All Disputes shall be resolved
          finally and exclusively by binding individual arbitration with a
          single arbitrator administered by ADR Services, Inc. or any other
          neutral service agreed to by the parties according to this provision
          and the applicable arbitration rules for that forum. Consumer
          claimants (individuals whose transaction is intended for personal,
          family, or household use) may elect to pursue their claims in their
          local small-claims court rather than through arbitration. The Federal
          Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. &sect;&sect; 1-16, fully applies. If you are
          a consumer bringing a claim relating to personal, household, or family
          use, any arbitration hearing will occur within the county or parish
          where you reside. Otherwise, any arbitration hearing will occur in
          Manhattan County in New York, or another mutually agreeable location,
          or a location ordered by the arbitrator. The arbitrator&rsquo;s award
          shall be binding on the parties and may be entered as a judgment in
          any court of competent jurisdiction. If you prevail on any claim for
          which you are legally entitled to attorney&rsquo;s fees, you may
          recover those fees from the arbitrator. For any claim where you are
          seeking relief, Company will not seek to have you pay its
          attorney&rsquo;s fees, even if fees might otherwise be awarded, unless
          the arbitrator determines that your claim was frivolous. For purposes
          of this arbitration provision, references to you and Company also
          include respective subsidiaries, affiliates, agents, employees,
          predecessors, successors, and assigns.&nbsp;
