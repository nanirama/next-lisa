          We collect information about you when you use our Platform, including,
          but not limited to the following:{" "}
        </p>
        <ul className="list-disc flex flex-col space-y-2 p-4">
          <li>
            Account Information. When you register with us using the Platform to
            create an account and become a registered user, you will need to
            provide us with certain personally identifiable information to
            complete the registration, including information that can be used to
            contact or identify you and payment or other billing information in
            some cases.
          </li>

          <li>
            Device Information. We may automatically collect certain information
            about the computer or devices (including mobile devices) you use to
            access the Services. For example, we may collect and analyze
            information such as (a) IP addresses, geolocation information (as
            described in the next section below), unique device identifiers and
            other information about your mobile phone or other mobile device(s),
            browser types, browser language, operating system, the state or
            country from which you accessed the Services; and (b) information
            related to the ways in which you interact with the Services, such
            as: referring and exit pages and URLs, platform type, the number of
            clicks, domain names, landing pages, pages and content viewed and
            the order of those pages, the amount of time spent on particular
            pages, the date and time you used the Services, the frequency of
            your use of the Services, error logs, and other similar information.
            As described further below, we may use third-party analytics
            providers and technologies, including cookies and similar tools, to
            assist in collecting this information.
          </li>

          <li>
            Location Information. We may collect different types of information
            about your location, including general information (e.g., IP
            address, zip code) and more specific information (e.g., GPS-based
            functionality on mobile devices used to access the Services), and
            may use that information to customize the Services with
            location-based information, advertising, and features. For example,
            if your IP address indicates an origin in Los Angeles, California,
            the Services may be customized with Los Angeles-specific information
            and advertisements. In order to do this, your location information
            may be shared with our agents, vendors, or advertisers. If you
            access the Services through a mobile device and you do not want your
            device to provide us with location-tracking information, you can
            disable the GPS or other location-tracking functions on your device,
            provided your device allows you to do this. See your device
            manufacturer&rsquo;s instructions for further details.

            user preferences, lists of pages visited and activities conducted
            while using the Services. We use Cookies to help us improve or
            tailor the Services by tracking your navigation habits, storing your
            authentication status so you do not have to re-enter your
            credentials each time you use the Services, customizing your

          We may use a type of advertising commonly known as interest-based or

          websites and services based on information about your use of the
          Services and on your interests (as inferred from your online

            Web Beacons: &ldquo;Web Beacons&rdquo; (a.k.a. clear GIFs or pixel
            tags) are tiny graphic image files imbedded in a web page or email
            that may be used to collect anonymous information about your use of
            our Services, the websites of selected advertisers, and the emails,
            special promotions or newsletters that we send you. The information
            collected by Web Beacons allows us to analyze how many people are
            using the Services, using the selected advertisers&rsquo; websites
            or opening our emails, and for what purpose, and also allows us to
            enhance our interest-based advertising.

            Platform Analytics: We may use third-party analytics services in
            connection with the Platform, including, for example, to register
            mouse clicks, mouse movements, scrolling activity and text that you
            type into the Platform. These analytics services generally do not
            collect personal information unless you voluntarily provide it and
            generally do not track your browsing habits across sites which do
            not use their services. We use the information collected from these
            services to help make the Platform easier to use.
          </li>

          <li>
            Mobile Device Identifiers: Mobile device identifiers are data stored
            on your mobile device that may track mobile device and data and
            activities occurring on and through it, as well as the applications
            installed on it. Mobile device identifiers enable collection of
            personal information (such as media access control, address and
            location) and traffic data. Mobile device identifiers help Green
            Bell Health learn more about our users&rsquo; demographics and
            internet behaviors.

          payment for the provision of healthcare. In conducting its business,
          Green Bell Health may receive and create records containing your PHI.
          Green Bell Health is required by law to maintain the privacy of your
          PHI and to provide you with notice of its legal duties and privacy
          practices with respect to your PHI.
