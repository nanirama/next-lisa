          <div className="flex flex-col space-y-4  ">
            <p>
              1) Complete our brief assessment online so we can learn about your
              medical history. Based on this, we will assess whether we can help
              you.
            </p>
            <p>
              2) If you are a fit for our practice, you will be able to schedule
              an online visit. Please note that we are happy to take patients
              even if they have not been treated previously.
            </p>
            <p>
              3) Before your reservation is confirmed, you will need upload
              images of government-issued photo ID as well as fill out further
              intake information.
            </p>
            <p>
              4) A visit with Lina is much like a regular doctor visit, except
              that it is conducted digitally. We take cyber-security seriously;
              all visits are done via a secure, HIPAA-compliant videochat. The
              first visit is an online visit with a mental health expert.
            </p>
            <p>
              We do not cut corners or skip any important aspects of a full
              psychiatric evaluation; your provider will perform a full
              psychiatric evaluation. Our providers only prescribe medication if
              it is appropriate for your situation.

            help as many people as possible. If your state is not listed here,
            please complete our online assessment and we&apos;ll prioritize you
            on our waitlist. We require proof of residency upon booking an
            appointment (a driver&apos;s license works).

            <h4 className="font-bold">Visits</h4>
            Lina is an out-of-network provider with insurance companies for
            visits. An <b>out-of-network</b> claim means that your health
            insurance company can reimburse you for money spent on healthcare
            that is from a provider not normally covered in your
            insurance&apos;s network. Lina provides you with a superbill to
            submit to your insurance to cover visit fees.
            <h4 className="mt-4 font-bold">Medication</h4>
            You can use your insurance to pay for medication at your local
            pharmacy. If you want your prescription shipped, we charge $15 for
            all medication, with shipping included for free.
